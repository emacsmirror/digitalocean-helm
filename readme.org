Emacs library for working with digitialocean, if you don't have a digitalocean account consider creating one 
using this referal link for a perk for bot of us.

This was written to help me learn some lisp, the code is hopefulyl quite easy to follow as I am not an expert in lisp.

* API Access Setup
First create a token on digitalocean, once created copy the token and set the =digitalocean-token= variable examples below.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq digitalocean-token (concat "Bearer " "you digitalocean token here."))
#+END_SRC

It is recommended you use a secure way of storing this, something like the below
which uses the unix password store https://www.passwordstore.org/ plugin for emacs, but there are other options.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq digitalocean-token (concat "Bearer " (password-store-get "token/digitalocean")))
#+END_SRC

* Getting started
All commands are prefixed do/ and are not bound to any keys this is left to the user.
You will probably want to bind at least these functions.
